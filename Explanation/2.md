## Problem 2 - Missing Number
We are given the value of 'n' i.e. the total set of numbers and also we are given all n-1 numbers which may not be consecutive.
Note : The number sequence is consecutive i.e. 1,2,3,4,5 ........n
And we are required to find the missing one.

The logic is we will subtract the sum of n-1 numbers from sum of n numbers.
Formula to find the sum of n numbers : n(n+1)/2

The sum of n-1 numbers can be found by adding them iteratively while taking as input.
