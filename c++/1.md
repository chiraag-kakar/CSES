## Problem 1 - Weird Algorithm

In this problem we have to first take a number 'n' as input and then check if it is odd or even.
If the number is odd then : n = 3n + 1.
If the number is even then : n = n/2.
Finally print the sequence starting from the number taken as input i.e. 'n' till the number is greater than 1.

## C++ Solution
Solution 1 :
The logic to check if the number is odd or even is implemented using bitwise operators.
Note : Bitwise operations are performed on binary numbers.


Solution 2 :
The logic to check if the number is odd or even is implemented using modulo operator.
